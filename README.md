# Swapify

An E-commerce platform designed to trade items between users instead of selling and
buying with money. Users can upload items they wish to trade and either display them
publicly for trading or keep them hidden while still being available for exchange.

Once the publishing user agrees on the exchanged item, the transaction is complete.

This project targets individuals looking for cost-effective alternatives to shopping,
encouraging reusing, and community-driven exchanges.

## Objectives
- Build a flexible, user-friendly platform where individuals can trade items easily.
